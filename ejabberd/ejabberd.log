E(<0.35.0>:ejabberd_config:282) : Error reading Mnesia database spool files:
The Mnesia database couldn't read the spool file for the table 'config'.
ejabberd needs read and write access in the directory:
   /var/lib/ejabberd/spool
Maybe the problem is a change in the computer hostname,
or a change in the Erlang node name, which is currently:
   ejabberd@talk
Check the ejabberd guide for details about changing the
computer hostname or Erlang node name.
